Chromecast command line and web control tool

Requirements:
- ruby
- ffmpeg

Installation:
rubycast depends on some ruby gems, see Gemfile for dependencies
You can simply install the dependencies with bundler :
$ bundle install
Then prefix your command with bundle :
$ bundle exec ruby -I lib bin/rubycast.rb

Usage:
Chromecast need an HTTP server to get video from. To be able to play local video files, you need to launch rubycast HTTP server with :
$ ruby -I lib bin/rubycast.rb --httpd
The rubycast.rb HTTP server includes a small web interface that you can reach within your web browser : http://yourlocalip:8015/
The explorer will map to /tmp by default, but you can define the root directory :
$ ruby -I lib bin/rubycast.rb --httpd --root /media/Videos

If you just want to stop/play/pause, you can use rubycast.rb as command line :
$ ruby -I lib bin/rubycast.rb -c stop

See the whole options with
$ ruby -I lib bin/rubycast.rb -h
